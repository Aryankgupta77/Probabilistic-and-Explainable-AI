# Probabilistic-and-Explainable-AI

This module commences by introducing probabilistic programming, an emerging area at the intersection of  programming languages probability theory and probabilistic artificial intelligence It then shows how to define probabilistic AI models and inference algorithms using executable code in probabilistic programming languages.  Examples of modeling formalisms include  generalized linear models neural networks Gaussian process hierarchical Bayesian models Bayesian networks and causal networks. Examples of inference approaches include  Monte Carlo methods expectation-maximization variational approaches It focuses on explainability, or other procedural values in AI-enabled decisions. Emphasis is on applying these techniques to real data in a variety of application areas.
